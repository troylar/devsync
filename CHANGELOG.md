## [0.14.0] - 2026-02-22

### Added
- **Extract command UX improvements** (#86, #88)
  - `--dry-run` flag to preview detected components without writing files or calling the LLM
  - `--include-global` flag replacing the confusing three-way `--scope` option

  - `--component` filter to extract specific component types only (repeatable)
  - Multi-tool MCP server detection across all registered IDE config paths
  - IDE capability registry driving detection locations
  - Component-level filtering with `filter_detection_result()`

### Changed
- `--scope` option on `devsync extract` is now deprecated in favor of `--include-global`
- Extract command now shows detection summary before running extraction
- Extraction output enhanced with per-tool breakdown

### Fixed

## [0.13.0] - 2026-02-22

### Added
- **Pip-installable MCP server support** (#80)

  - `pip_package` field on `MCPDeclaration` with allowlist validation
  - Interactive pip install during `devsync install` with version constraint checking
  - `--skip-pip` flag to skip pip installations for MCP servers

### Fixed
- Stale v1 references in CLAUDE.md (#63)

## [0.12.0] - 2026-02-21

### Added
- **DevSync v2.0 — AI-Powered Config Distribution** (#63)
  - 6 streamlined CLI commands replacing 20+: `setup`, `tools`, `extract`, `install`, `list`, `uninstall`
  - AI-powered practice extraction: LLM reads project rules and produces abstract practice declarations
  - AI-powered installation: LLM adapts incoming practices to recipient's existing setup with intelligent merging
  - LLM provider abstraction layer (Anthropic, OpenAI, OpenRouter) via HTTP — no SDK dependencies
  - Graceful degradation: works without API key using file-copy mode (`--no-ai` flag)
  - v2 package format (`devsync-package.yaml`) with `practices` section
  - Backward compatibility with v1 `ai-config-kit-package.yaml` packages
  - MCP credential prompting with masked input during installation
  - `devsync setup` — interactive LLM provider configuration
  - `devsync extract` — extract practices from any project with AI or file-copy mode
  - `devsync install` — install packages from Git URLs, local paths, or directories
  - `devsync list` — show installed packages with tool filtering and JSON output
  - v1 package upgrade via `devsync extract --upgrade`

### Fixed
- Temp directory leak when cloning Git repos during install
- LLM JSON responses wrapped in markdown fences now parsed correctly
- `parse_adaptation_response` now reads `practice_name` from JSON instead of defaulting to empty
- `--conflict` flag now properly honored (skip/overwrite/rename strategies)
- `extract --upgrade` returns correct exit code when no instruction files found
- Path traversal protection uses `Path.relative_to()` instead of string prefix check
- Windows path separator handling in tests (use Path objects instead of string comparison)
- Removed stale `tui.installer` import that caused mypy failures

### Security
- MCP credential input now masked with `password=True`
- Path traversal guard added to both install and extract commands

### Documentation
- Complete ReadTheDocs rewrite for v2 architecture (47 files updated)
- New CLI pages: `setup.md`, `extract.md`
- Rewritten: `install.md`, `list.md`, quickstart, concepts, CLI reference
- Updated tutorials, IDE integrations, and package documentation
- Removed obsolete v1 pages (download, update, delete, MCP server section)

## [0.3.1] - 2025-10-27

### Fixed
- Git repository updates now work correctly - `.git` directory is preserved during download (#16)
  - Previously, downloading from Git URLs would skip the `.git` directory, preventing `aiconfig update --all` from working
  - Update command would show "Not a Git repository (local source)" for all Git-based repositories
  - Now the entire `.git` directory is copied to the library alongside instruction files
  - Enables proper Git-based updates via `aiconfig update --all` and `aiconfig update --namespace`
  - Local (non-Git) sources continue to work as before

## [0.3.0] - 2025-10-27

### Breaking Changes
- **GitHub Copilot file extension**: Instructions now use `.instructions.md` extension (was `.md`) (#15)
  - Required by GitHub Copilot's [official specification](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/configure-custom-instructions/add-repository-instructions)
  - Previous installations with `.md` extension will not be recognized by Copilot
  - **Action required** if you have existing Copilot instructions:
    ```bash
    aiconfig uninstall <instruction-name> --tool copilot
    aiconfig install <instruction-name>
    ```
  - Affects: GitHub Copilot only (Cursor, Claude Code, Windsurf unchanged)

### Added
- Git-based repository versioning support - download and manage multiple versions of instruction repositories
  - `aiconfig download --ref <tag|branch|commit>` to download specific Git references
  - Support for tags (e.g., `v1.0.0`), branches (e.g., `main`), and commit hashes
  - Multiple versions of the same repository can coexist in the library
  - Version information tracked in installation records (`source_ref` and `source_ref_type`)
  - Automatic update behavior: branch-based installs auto-update, tag/commit-based installs remain pinned
  - `aiconfig update` intelligently updates only mutable references (branches)
  - Version display in TUI installer and `aiconfig list` commands
- **Upgrade detection and prompts** - when installing a newer version of an existing instruction:
  - Automatically detects version changes (e.g., v1.0.0 → v2.0.0)
  - Displays side-by-side version comparison with old and new versions
  - Prompts for user confirmation before upgrading
  - Works across all AI tools (Cursor, Claude Code, Copilot, Windsurf)
- **Name collision handling** - when installing instructions with duplicate names from different repositories:
  - Detects when instruction name already exists from a different repository
  - Displays detailed information about existing and new installations
  - Allows users to provide custom filename to avoid conflicts
  - Option to skip installation if collision cannot be resolved
  - `find_instructions_by_name()` method in `InstallationTracker` for collision detection
- New `RefType` enum for tracking Git reference types (tag, branch, commit)
- `GitOperations` class with functions for:
  - `detect_ref_type()` - automatically determine if a reference is a tag, branch, or commit
  - `validate_remote_ref()` - verify Git references exist on remote before cloning
  - `clone_at_ref()` - clone repository at a specific Git reference
  - `check_for_updates()` - check if updates are available for branch-based repos
  - `pull_repository_updates()` - pull latest changes with conflict detection
- Versioned namespace generation in `LibraryManager`:
  - `get_versioned_namespace()` - creates unique namespaces like `repo@v1.0.0`
  - `list_repository_versions()` - lists all downloaded versions of a repository
- Enhanced update command with progress bars and detailed status reporting
- Comprehensive unit tests: 72 new tests, improving coverage from 46% to 57%

### Changed
- `InstallationRecord` now includes `source_ref` and `source_ref_type` fields for version tracking
- Library organization now supports version-specific namespaces (e.g., `github_com_user_repo@v1.0.0`)
- Update workflow now filters installations by ref mutability (only updates branches)
- Installation workflow now includes upgrade and collision checks before file operations

## [0.2.0] - 2025-10-24

### Changed
- Project-scoped installations now use relative paths in `installations.json` for version control compatibility (#8, #9)
- Removed `project_root` field from `InstallationRecord` model
